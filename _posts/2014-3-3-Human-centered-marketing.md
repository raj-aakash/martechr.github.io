# Human Centered Marketing: How Incorporating UX design principles can 10x your marketing ROI.

***Summary:** This article details an unconventional approach to planning and executing marketing strategy that would result in a stronger brand,  satisfied customers and higher returns on marketing budget.* 

### **Great. An**other Click bait.

Marketers, hear me out before you groan out loud. UX design and its benefits aren't merely restricted to designing landing pages 'that convert'. And it's uses aren't limited to merely product design alone. UX design has the potential to revolutionize your marketing strategy and reinvent existing ways to connect with new prospects. 

### Marketing. D'oh!

Ever since the beginning, marketing strategies was built solely around the product. The job of the marketing department was to inform the potential customers about the product, its benefits and advantages. Classic marketing method follows the same pattern: 

1. grabbing attention of your potential customers by using different channels.
2. Telling them (or rather forcing them) your story.
3.  Selling them your product. 

The digital era may have given way to new methods of grabbing a person's attention, but the classic method still continues.

Largely because this method works. And will continue to work. At least for the top 1% of brands which are already successful and have a very large fan base of people who are extremely vocal about their endorsement. Such brands can continue to throw money at new ways to grab attention in hopes of improving the bottom line. 

If you belong to the rest of the 99%, this approach may not work (unless you are working in a blue-ocean market). You're not marketing to faceless users. You are marketing to living breathing humans. Human who are the hero in their own story, seeking solutions to their problems so THEY can succeed. They don't care about you. not yet.  Your marketing efforts has to be all about THEM. 

This is where UX comes in. UX designers have been preaching for human-first approach since the very beginning. Since humans lie in center of every UX decision, user-centered design ( UCD) methodology can be directly stolen and used to re-think marketing strategy. UX design has been predominantly of interest to the technical and product dev department. As a result, in most organizations,the UX and marketing efforts still often occur in silos.

### Basics of User Centered Design for the uninitiated.

UCD is an approach of designing solutions after observing, researching and evaluating the users' needs and iterating this cycle multiple times until the user's needs are completely met. Users are observed closely, in their home environment, to research different contexts of use. Solutions are built to solve these requirements and the users are observed interacting with this product.

The product is continuously evaluated against requirement and the iteration only ends when all the requirements are met. 

### Got it... how does it translate to marketing though?

If you center your marketing strategy around the customer, you are forced to think from the perspective of a customer. You get ground reality of the problems the customer is facing and are more empathic towards them. Instead of planning your marketing communication first and re-wrapping this content to pass off as informative, you put your customers needs first. 

This can completely change the classic marketing method.

1. Instead of finding unique ways to grab their attention, you become invested in finding opportunities to solve their problems and provide value to them.
2. '*Our Product*', 'O*ur Features*', and 'O*ur Benefits',* the most common marketing scripts get replaced by content that sync with the user. 
3. Because of how much brand loyalty you have accrued by just 'getting' them, people will be more eager to invest (inherently positive emotion) in you and wouldn't consider this payment to be an expense (inherently negative emotion). 

### Maybe all that is true. But it wouldn't work for our product.

True. Human centric Marketing cannot be enforced by 1 person or even a team. This process can only work if you have buy-in from all stakeholders involved. HCM requires multi-disciplinary teams researching into needs of users, running frequent experiments on how audience perceives our brand and streamlining until you hit sweet success. 

1. With close user involvement, your efforts are more likely to meet users’ expectations. This leads to increased sales and lower costs incurred by customer services.
2. Your marketing campaigns will be better tailored for people in specific contexts and with specific tasks, thereby reducing the chances of situations with a high risk of marketing error arising. 
3. Putting marketers in close contact with users means a deeper sense of empathy emerges. This is essential in creating marketing campaigns that respect privacy and the quality of life.
4. By focusing on all users of a product, marketers can recognize the diversity of cultures and human values through HCM. This brings you one step closer to assuring sustainable growth.

Research shows that companies that invest in UX design boost their bottom line by up to **228%** over those which don’t.

### I'm sold. Let me check out some UX resources.

Word of advice. ****As a marketer, you have a knack for learning things in order to use it to your advantage. Please don't. If you try to use your knowledge of UX to game the system you will eventually turn your users against you [and they will against you with pitchforks].

Remember. Humans **first!**
